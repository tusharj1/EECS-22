BINGO GAME:

We are given an input file. I read the file first and assort out the components that I need for the game. I use the variable m as for my number of players and n and the no of tiles. I open the file and read it. I separate into different components : namesList, bingoName ,tile, lastLine, tracker. namesList is used to hold the names of the players and ensure that there aren’t more than 64 characters. bingoName will store names of the players that got BINGO!. Trackers keeps in check the numbers that have been called. 
I read the names, separate the numbers, and note the called list of numbers and process them. I identify my diagonals, rows and columns with the help of for loops and my algorithm to check for Bingo! By default, I make all the numbers in tile to be false and combine it with the tracker to see which player’s column, row, or diagonal receives a bingo first. If the number called matches the number in tiles I make it Green in color and the numbers that are marked by the player in Red. Also I reset other tiles to be black.
