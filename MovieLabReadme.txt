For Homework 5: We were asked to design a program to take command line arguments instead of an interactive menu. We load the  frames of the movie, design a linked list of images to represent the movie in our program and apply the necessary DIP functions to it. I first started working on my ImageList.c file and completed it with implementing the necessary functions, keeping the basic operations of my linked list in mind.
Just like that then I complete my IterativeFilter.c , MovieLab.c , Movie.c , Makefile for all my programs, ImageList.c and DIPs.c.
